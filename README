Introduction

Virtual Gemstone creates a fully functioning VirtualBox virtual machine that runs smalltalk in the Gemstone Object Oriented Database proxied behind Nginx, a high performance easy configuration webserver. 
The nginx installation is configured to use ssl by default, because we care about a secure browsing experience for our users, and we want to use the same configuration in development as in production.
Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com) and veewee are used to generate a fresh 'box' from a debian iso.

Installation

git clone https://github.com/<repository>/virtual-gemstone.git 

create a vagrant base box using veewee:

create a box from the base box, and run the gemstone and nginx installation and configuration scripts.

cd vagrant
vagrant up

test it:

log in to the box

vagrant ssh

use the text browser in the box to see the site

lynx https://localhost



How it works
Virtual Gemstone is built on Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com), a command line interface that lets you create, destroy VMs at will, and run Puppet or Chef configuration management scripts
We use veewee to generate the vagrant vm from a standard debian VM, so you can be 100% sure where your VM comes from, and you can configure it as you wish.
